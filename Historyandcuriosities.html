  <h3>Early Years</h3>
  <p class="pstyle">Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) 
  depot at Newton Heath. The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first 
  recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team. By 1888, the club had 
  become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly 
  formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the First
  Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the "LYR" from its name. After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second 
  Division.</p>
  <p class="pstyle"> In January 1902, with debts of &pound;2,670 – equivalent to &pound;280,000 in 2019[nb 1] – the club was served with a winding-up order.
  In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining 
  promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934.</p>

  <h3>Present</h3>
  <p class="pstyle">Manchester United have won more trophies than any other club in English football, with a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, five League Cups and a record 21 FA 
  Community Shields. United have also won three UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA Europa League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one <b>UEFA Super Cup</b>, one Intercontinental Cup and one 
  FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998–99, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the continental European treble. By winning the UEFA Europa League 
  in 2016–17, they became one of five clubs to have won all three main UEFA club competitions.</p>
  <p class="pstyle">In July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead. Shares were originally set to go on sale for between &dollar;16 and &dollar;20 each, but the 
  price was cut to &dollar;14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the 
	  cut, Manchester United was valued at <b>&dollar;2.3 billion</b>, making it the most valuable football club in the world.Manchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2016–17, with an annual
	  revenue of <b>&euro;676.3 million</b>, and the world's third most valuable football club in 2019, valued at <b>&pound;3.15 billion</b> (&dollar;3.81 billion). As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable football brand, estimated 
	  to be worth <b>&dollar;1.2 billion.</b></p>
